/* This is a placeholder - you would replace this with actual icon files.
 * For a portfolio project hosted on GitHub.io, you could:
 * 1. Generate proper icons at https://realfavicongenerator.net/
 * 2. Use a tool like Figma or Canva to create custom icons
 * 3. Use an SVG image and convert it to various sizes

/* 
README - ICONS:
To fully implement PWA features, you would need to create properly sized icons:
- icon-72x72.png (72×72)
- icon-96x96.png (96×96)
- icon-128x128.png (128×128)
- icon-144x144.png (144×144)
- icon-152x152.png (152×152)
- icon-192x192.png (192×192)
- icon-384x384.png (384×384)
- icon-512x512.png (512×512)
- favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32)

For a proper implementation, you would design a simple logo for the game (perhaps a colorful
peg with a ball) and generate these sizes.
